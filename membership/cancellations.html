                          <h1>Cancellations</h1>
                          <h2>Policy</h2>
				<p>At the Blomeyer Health Fitness Center, our goal is to accommodate our members in every possible way. That even includes making it hassle free to cancel your membership when you deem necessary. We do not hold our members to a minimum contract for their monthly membership, therefore you can cancel at any time. However, the BHFC does require that you adhere to the cancellation policy that you signed on your membership application. </p>
				<p>As stated on your application, our cancellation requirement is that you give The Blomeyer Health Fitness Center a <strong>30-day written notice</strong> informing us of your desire to cancel your membership. Your written cancellation must be received <strong>before the 7th of the month</strong> for payroll deductions or bank drafts to cease in that month. All cancellations received after the 7th will result in deductions/drafts for the following month as well. </p>
				<p>Once your cancellation notice is received by the BHFC, you will have access to the facility until the <strong>last day</strong> of the month in which your last deduction/draft takes place.</p>
				<p>We encourage you to fill out a written cancellation at the BHFC front desk. If this is not feasible, you have the option of email (<a href="mailto:blomeyer@emory.edu">blomeyer@emory.edu</a>), mail, or fax (404-727-4730).</p>
				<p>However, if your cancellation is emailed, mailed, or faxed, we cannot guarantee receipt. We have no control over whether it arrives at the Center. Therefore, it is <strong>your responsibility to call and confirm</strong> we received your cancellation notice. Members whose cancellations are done at the BHFC front desk will receive a verifiable copy (signed by the staff) for their files.</p>
				<p><strong>Cancellations cannot be taken over the phone. They must be in writing.</strong></p>
				
				<h2>Forms</h2>
				<p>Please use the following forms to cancel your membership:</p>
				<ul class="list">
					<li><a href="../docs/MembershipResignation.pdf" target="_blank">Membership Resignation</a></li>
					<li><a href="../docs/LockerCancellation.pdf" target="_blank">Locker Rental Cancellation</a></li>
					<li><a href="../docs/AffiliateParkingCancellation.pdf" target="_blank">Affiliate Parking Cancellation</a></li>
				</ul>
				
				<h2>Examples</h2>
				<p>The following are examples to supplement the above information:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Jane Doe faxed a written cancellation to the Blomeyer Health Fitness Center on January 6th. The same day she called and verified that we received her fax. Her last monthly deduction will be during the month of January and she has access to the facility until January 31st.</li>
					<li>Jane Doe came in and filled out a written cancellation with the Blomeyer Health Fitness Center front desk on January 8th. Her last monthly deduction will be for the month of February and she has access to the facility until February 28th.</li>
					<li>John Doe mailed a written cancellation on October 30th. He failed to call and verify our reception of his cancellation and the staff at the Blomeyer Health Fitness Center never received his information. Mr. Doeâ€™s deductions continued for the next few months until he noticed he was being debited. Mr. Doe contacted BHFC and it was explained to Mr. Doe that there was no way for us to cancel his membership if we never received a cancellation notice and no call was made to verify. Therefore, Mr. Doe had to resubmit his cancellation form on Dec 5th and his last deduction occurred in December instead of October. His access to the BHFC continued until December 31st.</li>
