				<p>The Blomeyer Member of the Month for January 2013 is <strong>David Bloomquist</strong>. Congratulations, David!</p>
				
                <p><strong> How did you start your wellness lifestyle?</strong>
                <br>Four years ago I was overweight, had high blood pressure, and was pre-diabetic. My doctor told me to make some changes. More importantly, I didn’t feel good about myself. I started walking a bit. My walks became longer. Then I started jogging. My daughter convinced me to try running a 5K race. I ran part, walked part. Something started to click. My goal became to run a 5K without slowing to a walk. 5K’s became 10K’s. I ran my first Peachtree Road Race four years ago with my daughter, though she left me behind. I decided to start taking training seriously, and the rest, as they say, is history.</p>
				
                <p><strong>What have you accomplished thus far concerning your health?</strong>
                <br>I’ve lost 65 pounds, got off of the blood pressure medications, and reduced my waist size by six inches. In the past year I’ve run four full marathons and five half marathons. I’m a volunteer coach for the Atlanta Track Club.</p>
				
                <p><strong>What are your future wellness endeavors?</strong>
                <br>Most of my goals are about running. I’m always trying for a new “PR” (personal record). I’d like to break 20 minutes for a 5K and four hours for a full marathon. I’m considering trying a mini-triathlon. I’d like to beat James in FitTrip, but I’m more likely to win the lottery ;-)</p>
				
                <p><strong>Hometown?</strong>
                <br>Born in Urbana, IL. Raised in Doylestown, PA (just north of Philadelphia).</p>
				
                <p><strong>What types of hobbies and interests do you have outside of exercising?</strong>
                <br>Photography is my passion. I did it full time for a while years ago, and I still take lots of pictures, looking for that perfect shot. I also enjoy messing with computers when I have the time. </p>
				
                <p><strong>Fun fact about you:</strong>
                <br>I have three Master’s degrees.</p>
				
                <p><strong>Favorites:</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Favorite food: Veal parmigiana</li>
					<li>Movie: Silent Running (drones before there was Star Wars)</li>
					<li>Sport: Football</li>
					<li>Exercise: Running, spinning, working the weight machines</li>
					<li>Music: Most anything 70’s – Moody Blues, Electric Light Orchestra, Journey, etc.</li>
				</ul>

                <h2>Recipe: Steamed Artichoke</h2>
				<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>2-4 whole artichokes</li>
					<li>1 tbs lemon juice</li>
					<li>1 bay leaf</li>
					<li>Fresh garlic</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Directions:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Cut stem from artichokes and discard, making sure the bottom of each artichoke is flat. Cut top 1 inch (or so) of the artichoke and discard. Snip the thorny ends from each artichoke leaf with a pair of kitchen scissors.</li>
					<li>Fill the bottom of a pot with a couple of inches of water, adding garlic, lemon juice, and bay leaf to the water. Place a steamer basket in the pot, making sure that the water does not flow over the bottom of the steamer basket.</li>
					<li>Place the artichokes in the basket, resting on the flattened bottoms.</li>
					<li>Bring water to a boil, cover the pot, and cook until the leaves can be easily pulled from the artichoke, 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
					<li>To eat, pull off a leaf and scrape the meat off the tender end with your front teeth. Dip the ends of the leaves in lemon juice and melted butter if desired. When you reach the center cone of purple prickly leaves, remove it. This is the choke that protects the heart. Scrape away the thistle fuzz covering the artichoke heart.  The heart is the meatiest part of the artichoke and is delicious!</li>
				</ul>
