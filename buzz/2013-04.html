				<p>The Blomeyer Member of the Month for April 2013 is <strong>Bill Cassels</strong>. Congratulations, Bill!</p>
				
                <p><strong> How did you start your wellness lifestyle?</strong>
                <br>In November 2010 I enrolled in the Center for Health Discovery and Well Being program at Emory Mid-Town. Although I thought I was relatively healthy for my age, 59, after getting my body composition for muscle and fat I decided that I wasn't nearly as fit as I thought I was. Shortly thereafter I also signed up at Blomeyer at my wife's behest to join her for exercise.</p>
				
                <p><strong>What have you accomplished thus far concerning your health?</strong>
                <br>In the two years since joining Blomeyer in Jan 2011, I have dropped approximately 22 pounds of fat while adding approximately 10 pounds of muscle. My percent of fat to total body weight dropped from 30% to 19%. My aerobic stamina increased by similar results.</p>
				
                <p><strong>What are your future wellness endeavors?</strong>
                <br>I want to continue to maintain my current weight with aerobic exercise and continue to improve my strength training.</p>
				
                <p><strong>Hometown?</strong>
                <br>Cairo, GA</p>
				
                <p><strong>What types of hobbies and interests do you have outside of exercising?</strong>
                <br>Travel, yard and flower gardening, home improvement projects, snow skiing and golf (but no more than my wife and I get to play, it can't be considered anything more than a frustration!)</p>
				
                <p><strong>Fun fact about you:</strong>
                <br>I was a flight attendant for Eastern Airlines in my younger years and lived for a short time in New York. The actor, Richard Gere, was also a flight attendant with Eastern, and I hung out with him at a couple of parties there before he went to Hollywood. </p>
				
                <p><strong>Favorites:</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Favorite food: Seafood, most any kind from sushi to shrimp</li>
					<li>Movie: "Pretty Woman" (because I knew Richard Gere and thought Julia Roberts was a southern beauty and totally hot) </li>
					<li>Sport: Georgia football</li>
					<li>Exercise: Elliptical for cardio (not as hard on the damaged knees as running) and weights for strength</li>
					<li>Music: Bruce Springstein, Jimmy Buffet, the 60's and 70's oldies</li>
				</ul>
                
                
                <h2>Article of the Month: What is a Food Co-op?</h2>
				<p>Food co-ops are mainly very small grocery stores and possibly the most typical sort of cooperative. They're owned and managed by a group of people in the community which often includes local farmers. </p>
                <p>Usually food co-ops sell natural and organic foods that are in season. Over the past few years more people have come to comprehend the advantages of organic food and the demand has increased. Food co-ops are a fantastic selection for shoppers that need to find organic food at less costly prices.</p>
                <p>You can become a member of a food co-op by paying a membership fee which provides you all the benefits and features of being a member of the co-op. The membership fee varies with respect to the co-op but it will be set low enough to allow its members to recover the cost through the reasonable food prices. Membership in a food co-op also allows you to have a say in how the co-op is monitored.</p>
                <p>The members of a co-op are equal members and make the decisions pertaining to what kinds of food their co-op will carry and sell to the co-op members and the community. This enables everyone to feel like they are contributing equally. It also encourages democracy and community togetherness because members need to come together and combine their resources to be a success.</p>
                <p>If you need organic food and products at a bargain price and also assist your community then you should look into joining your local food co-op. It's a great way to get to know members of your community and become interested in helping your community have great food at good prices.</p>
