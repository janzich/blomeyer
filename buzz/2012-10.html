				<p>The Blomeyer Member of the Month for October 2012 is <strong>Robert Moore</strong>. Congratulations, Robert!</p>
				
                <p><strong> How did you start your wellness lifestyle?</strong>
                <br>In my mid 20’s to my mid 30’s I was in decent shape. For the past 10 years I have not exercised the way I need too and it showed it both my appearance and physical health. I woke up one morning and decided that I needed to recapture my youth and Blomeyer Health Fitness Center was the best place to start.</p>
				
                <p><strong>What have you accomplished thus far concerning your health?</strong>
                <br>I have lost 45lbs. in the past 5 months. My “body age” has decreased by two years.</p>
				
                <p><strong>What are your future wellness endeavors?</strong>
                <br>Would like to get my weight down to around 180 and maintain.</p>
				
                <p><strong>Hometown?</strong>
                <br>Grew up in Summerville, SC but Kennesaw, GA is my hometown now.</p>
				
                <p><strong>What types of hobbies and interests do you have outside of exercising?</strong>
                <br>I have two young daughters and my interest is being the best father I can be for them. </p>
				
                <p><strong>Fun fact about you:</strong>
                <br>Call me Mayor Rob. I am the mayor of Blomeyer Health Fitness Center on FourSquare. 30 check-in’s in the past two months. </p>

                <h2>Article of the Month: Improve Mental and Emotional Health by Taking Care of Yourself</h2>
				<p>In order to maintain and strengthen your mental and emotional health, it’s important to pay attention to your own needs and feelings. Don’t let stress and negative  emotions build up. Try to maintain a balance between your daily responsibilities and the things you enjoy. If you take care of yourself, you’ll be better prepared to deal with challenges if and when they arise.</p>
				<p>Taking care of yourself includes pursuing activities that naturally release endorphins and contribute to feeling good. In addition to physical exercise, endorphins are also naturally released when we:</p>
				<ul class="block-text">
					<li><strong>Do things that positively impact others.</strong> Being useful to others and being valued for what you do can help build self-esteem.</li>
					<li><strong>Practice self-discipline.</strong> Self-control naturally leads to a sense of hopefulness and can help you overcome despair, helplessness, and other negative thoughts.</li>
					<li><strong>Learn or discover new things.</strong> Think of it as “intellectual candy”. Try taking an adult education class, join a book club,  visit a museum, learn a new language, or simply travel somewhere new.</li>
					<li><strong>Enjoy the beauty of nature or art.</strong> Studies show that simply walking through a garden can lower blood pressure and  reduce stress. The same goes for strolling through a park or an art gallery, hiking, admiring architecture, or sitting on a beach.</li>
					<li><strong>Manage your stress levels.</strong> Stress takes a heavy toll on mental and emotional health, so it’s important to keep it under control. While not all stressors can be avoided, stress management strategies can help you bring things back into balance.</li>
					<li><strong>Limit unhealthy mental habits like worrying.</strong> Try to avoid becoming absorbed by repetitive mental habits – negative thoughts about yourself and the world that suck up time, drain your energy, and     trigger feelings of anxiety, fear, and depression.</li>
					<li>Appeal to your senses. Stay calm and energized by appealing to the five senses: sight, sound, touch, smell, and taste. Listen to music that lifts your mood, place flowers where you will see and smell them,      massage your hands and feet, or sip a warm drink.</li>
					<li><strong>Engage in meaningful, creative work. </strong>Do things that challenge your creativity and make you feel productive, whether or not you get paid for it – things like gardening, drawing, writing, playing an instrument, or building something in your workshop.</li>
					<li><strong>Get a pet.</strong> Yes, pets are a responsibility, but caring for one makes you feel needed and loved. There is no love quite as unconditional as the love a pet can give. Animals can also get you out of the house for exercise and expose you to new people and places.</li>
					<li><strong>Make leisure time a priority.</strong> Do things for no other reason than that it feels good to do them. Go to a funny movie, take a walk on the beach, listen to music, read a good book, or talk to a friend. Doing things just because they are fun is no indulgence. Play is an emotional and mental health  necessity.</li>
