                <h2>Article of the Month: Benefits of Family Meals</h2>
				<p>After-school activities, late workdays, long commutes -- it's no wonder few families eat dinner together. Yet studies show that the family dinner hour is an important part of healthy living.</p>
				<p>When families dine together, they tend to eat more vegetables and fruits -- and fewer fried foods, soda, and foods with trans fats, research shows. When younger kids frequently eat dinner with their families, they are less likely to be overweight than other children. That tends to change in the teenage years, when they're less likely to eat at home.</p>
				<p>It's a serious concern, since statistics show that nearly one in five children aged 6-19 in the U.S. are overweight. That puts them at higher risk for many health problems later in life, including heart disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes -- as well as emotional problems.</p>
				<p>"One of the simplest and most effective ways for parents to be engaged in their teens' lives is by having frequent family dinners," says Joseph Califano Jr., chairman and president of The National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University (CASA).</p>
				<p>CASA recently reported on a national phone survey of 1,000 teens and 829 parents of teens. Eating dinner as a family helped kids in many ways. It helped them get better grades, and kept them away from cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana, and more.</p>
				<p><strong>12 Benefits of Family Dinners</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Everyone eats healthier meals.</li>
					<li>Kids are less likely to become overweight or obese.</li>
					<li>Kids more likely to stay away from cigarettes.</li>
					<li>They're less likely to drink  alcohol.</li>
					<li>They’re less likely try marijuana.</li>
					<li>They're less likely to use illicit drugs.</li>
					<li>Friends won't likely abuse prescription drugs.</li>
					<li>School grades will be better.</li>
					<li>You and your kids will talk more.</li>
					<li>You'll be more likely to hear about a serious problem.</li>
					<li>Kids will feel like you're proud of them.</li>
					<li>There will be less stress and tension at home.</li>
