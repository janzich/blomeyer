				<h2>Members of the Month: Michael Milan and Doug Holly</h2>
                            
                <p>The Member of the Month section provides a way for us to recognize dedicated Blomeyer members who have been working hard and cosistently to get in better health and shape with the help of the BHFC. If you know a fellow Blomeyer member whose efforts should not go unnoticed, please tell us!</p>
                <p>To nominate someone, please send us an email at <a href="mailto:blomeyer@emory.edu">blomeyer@emory.edu</a> with the name and a few highlights of the person you'd like to see as our next Member of the Month.</p>
				
				<p>The Blomeyer Members of the Month for November 2013 are <strong>Michael Milan and Doug Holly</strong>. Congratulations, Michael and Doug!</p>
				
                <h3>How did you start your wellness lifestyle?</h3>
                <p><strong>Michael: </strong>My girl/woman friend, Pat, is a role model for the wellness lifestyle. (Question: is there a better term than “significant other” for a quarter-century companion?  If there is, please get back to me on that.)  Ever since we met, Pat has been on my case, encouraging me to get with the program.  Before I retired, I claimed that my work filled my days and occupied my thoughts, leaving little to no time for exercise and meal planning.  Excuse or justification?  At the end of my retirement party, she put her hands on her hips, looked me in the eye, and said “Well?”  I joined the Blomeyer the next Monday. 
                <br><strong>Doug: </strong>In a rush.</p>
				
                <h3>What have you accomplished thus far concerning your health?</h3>
                <p><strong>Michael: </strong>The question should be “What has the Blomeyer accomplished?”  And the answer is that the exercise regimen developed for me by the Blomeyer staff and Ken Haskins most probably helped save my life.  Time for a shout-out to the Fire-Rescue team at DeKalb Fire Station Number 1 and Emory’s ER, ICU, and PT Departments, without which I would no longer be!  My near-death experience was a pulmonary embolism a few days after abdominal surgery (blood clots are not an uncommon occurrence), an experience so near death that when Pat called to check on my condition the day after admission she was told “We don’t think he’s going to make it.”  Without the preceding three years of Blomeyer’s cardio-vascular and physical conditioning, all agreed that I probably would not have made it.  
                <br><strong>Doug: </strong>I can get up the outside stairs without stopping!</p>
				
                <h3>What are your future wellness endeavors?</h3>
                <p><strong>Michael: </strong>As I age, my goal is to defend as best I can against the inevitable effects of aging so that I may make use of and enjoy my remaining days to the greatest degree possible--for me.  I would also like to see my heart rate increase a bit less as I do my stair-climbs, but after 10 years I have just about given up on that! 
                <br><strong>Doug: </strong>Taking one day at a time and being grateful for each day. </p>
				
                <h3>Hometown?</h3>
                <p><strong>Michael: </strong>Do people still have hometowns in the tradition of Beaver Cleaver and Mayberry?  Well, it all started in Brooklyn.  But if the question is where was I during the formative years, I would have to include up-state towns, mainly Oneonta, Rome and Syracuse.  And then numerous other towns during my adulthood.  But when people ask where am I from, it is Atlanta. 
                <br><strong>Doug: </strong>Washington Crossing, Pennsylvania</p>
				
                <h3>What types of hobbies and interests do you have outside of exercising?</h3>
                <p><strong>Michael: </strong>All the things Atlanta has to offer, including the ASO, the Horizon, the Alliance, the Beltway, the Dogwood Festival and Virginia-Highland Summerfest, the Petit Le Mans, and on and on . . .  
                <br><strong>Doug: </strong>Reading, music, interesting jigsaw puzzles </p>
				
                <h3>Fun fact about you:</h3>
                <p><strong>Doug: </strong> I’ve retired!</p>
				
                <h3>Michael's Favorites:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Favorite food: I still believe that pizza is one of the basic food groups.</li>
					<li>Movie: Just about anything by Joel and Ethan Coen or Woody Allen, plus Apocalypse Now, Casablanca, Dr. Strangelove, On the Beach, To Kill a Mockingbird, the Godfather trilogy, Jaws, Star Wars, etc.</li>
					<li>Sport: My favorite spectator sport used to be football, but after Georgia Tech’s recent 56 – 0 rout of SU (my alma mater), I have developed an interest in bean-bag. </li>
					<li>Exercise: Walking out to the car after completing another full session.  Exercise is, for me, a have-to-do thing rather than a want-to-do thing.  So what keeps me coming even when I don’t feel quite up to it?  Pat’s spot-checking of my attendance and my recent teaming up with my neighbor, Doug, keep the motivation going. </li>
					<li>Music: A bit on the eclectic side--The three Bs, some C&amp;W (Nelson, Cash, Robins, and Tom T. Hall), folk (e.g., Baez, Seeger, the Weavers), jazz (e.g., Dukes of Dixieland,  Salt City Six), swing (e.g., Goodman, Shaw, James) and of course some pop (e.g., Anita O’Day,  Argo, Garland, Minnelli and even Madonna). </li>
				</ul>
                
                <h3>Doug's Favorites:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Favorite food: Himalayan Spice (Nepalese)</li>
					<li>Movie: The Day the Earth Stood Still, the 1951 original version</li>
					<li>Sport: Baseball</li>
					<li>Exercise: Walking up Stone Mountain</li>
					<li>Music: Opera, especially Wagner’s Ring cycle</li>
				</ul>

                <h2>Article of the Month: National Lung Cancer Awareness Month</h2>
				<h3>Tips to Quit Smoking</h3>
                <p>For one day out of every year, Americans rally around each other to quit smoking.  November 21st  marks the date of the American Cancer Society’s Great American Smokeout. It is a day that smokers across the nation try to quit smoking for good. Only about 4-7% of the 45 million smokers that attempt to quit smoking are successful without medicine or other forms of help.</p>
                <p>If you are part of the more than 90%, and if you haven’t been able to kick the habit since you’ve been diagnosed with cancer, give it a try November 21st - millions of people will be supporting you and trying to do the same.</p>
                <h3>Quitting Will Save Your Life</h3>
                <p>Smoking remains the most preventable cause of death in the United States. Tobacco use is the cause of about 1 of 5 deaths in the US, 1 of 3 cancer related deaths, and 4 of 5 lung cancer deaths. What does this mean? It means that if you quit smoking, it could save your life.</p>
                <h3>4 Steps on How to Start</h3>
                <p><strong>Make the Choice for Yourself</strong> - Only you can decide to quit. Outline the reasons why    quitting is important to you and remind yourself of them when you feel like giving in.</p>
                <p><strong>Pick a Date</strong> - Choosing a set date will hold you more accountable to yourself. Choose November 21st or another meaningful date.</p>
                <p><strong>Prepare for the Day</strong> - Do not be naive about quitting “cold turkey”. Prepare for the day by telling your friends and family, getting rid of all smoking related items in your home, planning substitutes (gum, things to munch on, etc.), decide on your method of quitting,  practice visualizing yourself saying “no”, find a support system, and be honest with yourself about the physical and mental withdrawals ahead.</p>
                <p><strong>Kick It for Good</strong> - Quitting for life is no easy feat. It may be one of the hardest things you do during your battle with cancer. The biggest tip is willpower and      determination. Keep at it everyday, remind yourself why you quit, continue to get support, be realistic and do not give up if you slip and start smoking again. You can always quit.</p>
                <h3>Tobacco Use and Lung Cancer</h3>
                <ul>
                	<li>There is no safe way to smoke cigarettes. This includes menthol cigarettes, hand-rolled cigarettes, and herbal cigarettes.</li>
                    <li>Cigarette smoking is addictive. Nicotine is an addictive drug that all humans are susceptible to.</li>
                    <li>Smoking “occasionally” can still lead to lung cancer. Even smoking only 1 to 4 cigarettes a day can jeopardize your health.</li>
                    <li>Smoking “light” cigarettes does not put you at a lower risk.</li>
                    <li>If you do not inhale when you smoke, it still damages your lungs.</li>
                    <li>Chewing tobacco, smoking pipes, and cigars are all harmful to your lungs.</li>
                    <li>Secondhand smoke also causes lung cancer.</li>
                    <li>Smoking will affect women who are pregnant and can cause complications, miscarriages, premature births, having stillborn, and birth defects in your child.</li>
                    <li>If you are a lifelong smoker, it is still worth it to quit. Your body will start to restore itself and you will lower your chance of getting cancer.</li>
                </ul>
