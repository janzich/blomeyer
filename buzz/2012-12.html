				<p>The Blomeyer Member of the Month for December 2012 is <strong>John Altman</strong>. Congratulations, John!</p>
				
                <p><strong> How did you start your wellness lifestyle?</strong>
                <br>I’ve been exercising off-and-on for years (too much off and not enough on). I’ve also had rather undisciplined eating habits, and as a result, I’ve been overweight and out of shape for far too long. The first few months of 2012 were rather bad for me – I had spine surgery in January, and then my dad died. In April, I was on a couple of uncomfortable plane rides, sandwiched between two people who were even larger than me, and putting it all together, I decided it was time to get serious about getting in shape.</p>
				
                <p><strong>What have you accomplished thus far concerning your health?</strong>
                <br>Since the beginning of May 2012, I’ve managed to lose 50 pounds, and I plan never to see the north side of 200 again in my life. I did it by cutting out nearly all white food (bread, pasta, rice, potatoes) – this not been as hard as I expected it to be -- and by doing an hour or cardio 5-6 times a week, mostly at Blomeyer. Both changes are now ingrained habits, and even when I’m traveling, I’ve been seeking out gyms. </p>
				
                <p><strong>What are your future wellness endeavors?</strong>
                <br>I used to do a lot of road cycling before I moved to Atlanta, and I’d like to get back to it. I bought a decent bike a couple of years ago, and I’ve been doing weekend rides out to and around Stone Mountain. I’ve been talking for years about doing the AIDS Vaccine 200, a charity bike ride every May that raises money for AIDS research at the Emory Vaccine Center (where I’m a faculty member), and this year looks like it will finally be the year. Consider this my first request for donations...</p>
				
                <p><strong>Hometown?</strong>
                <br>Detroit. I caught the last game of the ALCS playoffs at Blomeyer – the Tigers whooped the Yankees – but the World Series against the Giants didn’t work out too well. I did live in San Francisco from 1984-1996, so if the Tigers had to lose to someone...</p>
				
                <p><strong>What types of hobbies and interests do you have outside of exercising?</strong>
                <br>My kids (though I’ll be an empty nest-er come fall), music (see below), reading (currently loving Michael Chabon’s “Wonder Boys” and David Byrne’s “How Music Works”), cooking, and work (I’m an immunologist). I’m trying to kick the political junkie habit, and maybe develop some more fulfilling new pursuits. I tried learning the guitar a couple of years ago – I’ve always wanted to play – but found it a bit painful in a more ways than one. Maybe now that I have the healthy-living discipline thing down...</p>
				
                <p><strong>Fun fact about you:</strong>
                <br>I don’t have an ACL in either knee. Wait, that’s not fun!</p>
				
                <p><strong>Favorites:</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Favorite food: Salmon, smoked on my Big Green Egg. Actually, pretty much anything cooked on the BGE.</li>
					<li>Movie: Almost anything by Terry Gilliam. I’ve always loved “Brazil”, though it’s kinda dark.</li>
					<li>Sport: No contest: Hockey! When I was a kid, my dad made a rink in our backyard every winter. I’m still sad the NHL couldn’t make it in Atlanta.</li>
					<li>Exercise: Biking. What else can you do without two ACLs?</li>
					<li>Music: Depends on the day. There’s a whole lot of Patti Smith, New York Dolls, Lucinda Williams, Richard Thompson, and Drive-by Truckers on my iPod right now.</li>
				</ul>

                 <blockquote>
                 If we had no winter, the spring would not be so pleasant: if we did not sometimes taste of adversity, prosperity would not be so welcome.
