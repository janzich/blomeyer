If you know a fellow Blomeyer member whose efforts should not go unnoticed, please tell us!</p>
                <p>To nominate someone, please send us an email at <a href="mailto:blomeyer@emory.edu">blomeyer@emory.edu</a> with the name and a few highlights of the person you'd like to see as our next Member of the Month.</p>
				
				<p>The Blomeyer Members of the Month for January 2014 are <strong>Brian Wilson and Tommy Wilson</strong>. Congratulations, Brian and Tommy!</p>
				
                <h3>How did you start your wellness lifestyle?</h3>
                <p><strong>Brian: </strong>1987 - high school football/basketball/track. I’ve tried to stay active/fit ever since. Thankfully, I’ve learned to correct most of what I did wrong (fitness-wise) in the beginning. 
                <br><strong>Tommy: </strong>I began my wellness lifestyle about 25 years ago, running 5-6 days a week and then started weight training.</p>
				
                <h3>What have you accomplished thus far concerning your health?</h3>
                <p><strong>Brian: </strong>I don’t know that I’ve “accomplished” much other than to simply stay healthy! Several years I ago I did compete in a couple of cycling events and was able to finish significantly better the second and third times around than I did in the first race. Since then I’ve mainly tried to be the healthiest, fittest version of myself that I can be.  
                <br><strong>Tommy: </strong>I workout 5-6 times a week and maintain my weight through a healthy diet.</p>
				
                <h3>What are your future wellness endeavors?</h3>
                <p><strong>Brian: </strong> To increase endurance. Lifting heavier and heavier weights is one thing; but to increase endurance AND strength is definitely a long-term goal. 
                <br><strong>Tommy: </strong>To start running again and to do more core training.</p>
				
                <h3>Hometown?</h3>
                <p><strong>Brian: </strong> Tulsa, Oklahoma. Born there, but actually raised in Sperry, Oklahoma – total population: 900 people. No stoplights :-)
                <br><strong>Tommy: </strong>Atlanta</p>
				
                <h3>What types of hobbies and interests do you have outside of exercising?</h3>
                <p><strong>Brian: </strong> The top hobby would be racing after my three (soon-to-be four) kids! Also, definitely reading – I constantly have a stack of books I’m working my way through. And film – both watching them and working on writing at least three or four screenplays (when I can find the time).  Photography. And, duh, fitness :-)
                <br><strong>Tommy: </strong>Snow skiing, spending time near the water - beach or lake.</p>
				
                <h3>Fun fact about you:</h3>
                <p><strong>Brian: </strong>I’ve tried to bicycle in every city/state I’ve lived in/visited: I’m up to about ten.  
                <br><strong>Tommy: </strong>I was born at Emory Midtown (Crawford Long)</p>
				
                <h3>Brian's Favorites:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Favorite food: Garlic pasta </li>
					<li>Movie: The greatest film of all time - Raiders of the Lost Ark</li>
					<li>Sport: Football </li>
					<li>Exercise: I like circuits - so any exercise that combines a well-executed circuit that results in muscle fatigue.  </li>
					<li>Music: It changes - I’ll listen to any style of music, as long as it’s a good song I’ll listen. </li>
				</ul>
                
                <h3>Tommy's Favorites:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Favorite food: Seafood, sushi</li>
					<li>Movie: Scarface</li>
					<li>Sport: Football</li>
					<li>Exercise: Weight training</li>
					<li>Music: Led Zeppelin, 60’s-70’s rock</li>
				</ul>
                <br>
                
                <h2>Article of the Month: Know Your Numbers</h2>
				<p><strong>Take healthy action</strong></p>
                <p>Your health is important! “Knowing Your Numbers” can help you make sure you are on the right path to living healthy and making smart health  decisions. </p>
                <p><strong>What is a health screening?</strong></p>
                <p>It is a simple health check that measures your blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose, and BMI (body mass index). If you participate in a screening and complete an <a href="http://www.hr.emory.edu/eu/screenings/assessment.html" target="_blank">online health assessment</a>, you can earn an <a href="http://www.hr.emory.edu/eu/benefits/incentives/incentives.html" target="_blank">incentive</a> on your Emory medical plan.</p>
                <p><strong>Options for receiving a screening</strong></p>
                <p>Option 1: Attend a free, onsite screening at Emory</p>
                <ul>
                	<li>Emory will offer free, onsite biometric screenings to employees, spouses/partners and retirees from January 13 - February 28, 2014. With over 50 locations to select from, this is the most convenient way to get screened. <a href="http://www.hr.emory.edu/eu/screenings/index.html" target="_blank">Online registration</a> is available now.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Option 2: Get a screening at your doctor's office</p>
                <ul>
                	<li>You can get a screening as part of your regular annual preventive exam. If you select this option, a <a href="http://www.hr.emory.edu/eu/docs/physician-consent-form-screenings.pdf" target="_blank">Personal Physician Off-Site Health Screening Form</a> must be completed by your doctor and faxed to Summit Health.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
