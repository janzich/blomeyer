                <p><strong> How did you start your wellness lifestyle?</strong>
                <br>I love martial arts, but being really big makes it hard to perform certain roundhouse kicks. So I began a daily stretching routine, after which I started adding cardio and weightlifting, and eventually morphed my diet to tie it all together.</p>
				
                <p><strong>What have you accomplished thus far concerning your health?</strong>
                <br>As of now I am 196 lbs of lean muscle mass. I have been working out for about 9 months now. My body composition is changing and my stamina is 30% more than what it was before. </p>
				
                <p><strong>What are your future wellness endeavors?</strong>
                <br>My future plans are really to make eating right and working out a lifestyle. </p>
				
                <p><strong>Hometown?</strong>
                <br>Gradybaby!</p>
				
                <p><strong>What types of hobbies and interests do you have outside of exercising?</strong>
                <br>Swam martial arts and boxing, swimming, reading poetry at Apache café and Java Monkey, and billiards. </p>
				
                <p><strong>Fun fact about you:</strong>
                <br>I was the biggest kid from kindergarten to high school and could not fit in a regular desk. </p>

                <h2>Article of the Month: Shape Up Your Plate</h2>
                <h3>Balancing Proteins from Animal and Plant Sources</h3>
				<p>Usually when people think of protein they think of meat, poultry, seafood and eggs. Other really good sources of protein include beans, peas, nuts, seeds and soy products.</p>
				<p>Although most Americans receive adequate protein in their diet, it is important to choose foods that are lean or low-fat. Plant sources of protein are naturally low in saturated fats and are high in fiber. For animal sources of protein, choose lean cuts of meat and keep cooking simple: try grilling, roasting, broiling or baking without any added oils or fats.</p>
				<p>It is recommended that adults eat 5-7 oz of protein/day. One ounce of protein is equivalent to about 1 oz meat, poultry or fish, 1 egg, 1/4 cup cooked beans, 1/2 oz nuts and seeds, or 1 tablespoon of peanut 
butter. Remember to eat a variety of protein sources throughout the week!</p>
				<h3>Get Your Cup “in Shape”</h3>
				<p>What do you drink when you are thirsty or need a quick pick-me-up? Soda? Latte? Koolaid? While these sugary drinks may be tasty, they can really pack on the pounds while contributing very few vitamins or other healthy nutrients to your diet.</p>
				<p>Did you know that consuming 100 extra calories each day can cause you to gain up to 10 pounds of extra body weight in a year? A 16oz bottle of soda has about 200 calories! Replacing that soda with water, coffee made with low-fat milk, or water with a splash of fruit juice will help get you and your cup “in shape.”</p>

					<li>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
