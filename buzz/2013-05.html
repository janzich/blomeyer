				<p>The Blomeyer Member of the Month for May 2013 is <strong>Ashley Bennett</strong>. Congratulations, Ashley!</p>
				<p><strong> How did you start your wellness lifestyle?</strong>
                <br>I started a regular workout routine about 5 years ago after the end of an unhealthy relationship. I decided to refocus any negative feelings from that experience into an elliptical frenzy. As time went on, I started branching out and adding weights and toning exercises to the routine as well.</p>
				
                <p><strong>What have you accomplished thus far concerning your health?</strong>
                <br>Since I started, I have lost at least 30 pounds and have never felt better. The free weight exercises have really paid off too. For the first time ever, I was the person that was able to open that pesky jar of pickles. You know the jar whose lid is tightened every night by vagabond gnomes?</p>
				
                <p><strong>What are your future wellness endeavors?</strong>
                <br>I want to keep up with the regular workout routine that I have started. I’m very happy about what I have achieved so far and am now just looking to tone things up. One thing I do feel I should acknowledge and work on is my little love affair with chocolate. It’s getting out of control!</p>
				
                <p><strong>Hometown?</strong>
                <br>Born and raised in Savannah, Georgia.</p>
				
                <p><strong>What types of hobbies and interests do you have outside of exercising?</strong>
                <br>I’m a big fan of the outdoors. I love horseback riding, camping, hiking, and relaxing on a beach. I also love to travel to basically anywhere. Now that the weather is warming up, I’m looking forward to taking mini vacations on the weekends to the mountains up north and the coast for some fun times.</p>
				
                <p><strong>Fun fact about you:</strong>
                <br>I do own a sombrero. It’s brightly colored, very gigantic, and has been designated as a new favorite drinking hat. I’m looking for two other sombrero owners to form a punk influenced mariachi band.</p>
				
                <p><strong>Favorites:</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Favorite food: Sushi, especially Spicy Tuna</li>
					<li>Movie: It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia</li>
					<li>Sport: Hockey</li>
					<li>Exercise: Still in the market for a favie exercise. It’s definitely not lounges though!</li>
					<li>Music: Dresdan Dolls, Iggy Pop, James Carr</li>

                <h2>Article of the Month: Global Employee Health &amp; Fitness Month</h2>
				<p><strong>What is Global Employee Health and Fitness Month and how does it work?</strong></p>
				<p>Global Employee Health &amp; Fitness Month (GEHFM) is an international and national observance of health and fitness in the workplace, created by two non-profit organizations, the National Association for Health &amp; Fitness and ACTIVE Life. The goal of GEHFM is to promote the benefits of a healthy lifestyle to employers and their employees through worksite health promotion activities and environments.</p>
				<p>Formerly National Employee Health &amp; Fitness Day, Global Employee Health &amp; Fitness Month has been extended to a month-long initiative in an effort to generate sustainability for a healthy lifestyle and initiate healthy activities on an ongoing basis.</p>
				<p>Employers everywhere are invited to participate in GEHFM. Throughout GEHFM employers will challenge their employees to create Healthy Moments, form Healthy Groups, and develop a Culminating Project. Participants will be able to log these activities on the GEHFM website throughout the month, allowing employers and employees to track, share, and promote their individual and group activities.</p>
				<p><strong>History of Global Health &amp; Fitness Month</strong></p>
				<p>From 1989-2010, tens of thousands of employees engaged in National Employee Health &amp; Fitness Day. However, it is clear that healthy behavior changes take time to develop into lifestyle habits. Recognizing the potential for making healthy habits, NAHF and ACTIVE Life decided that in 2011 a full month - and an international focus - would lead to healthier lifestyles and sustainable behavior change worldwide.</p>
