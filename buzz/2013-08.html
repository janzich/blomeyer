				<p>The Blomeyer Members of the Month for August 2013 are <strong>Sylvain Lehoux and Jean-Philippe Gourdine</strong>. Congratulations, Sylvain and Jean-Philippe!</p>
				
                <p><strong> How did you start your wellness lifestyle?</strong>
                <br><strong>Sylvain: </strong>I always tried to be in shape and to watch my food. Curiously, I lost about 10 lbs within my first 2 years in the US (I arrived in March 2010) without, apparently, big changes in my life and diet style. Since then I kept improving.
                <br><strong>JP: </strong>Thanks to one of Steve Job’s invention, I was able to enjoying running with my favorite things, music (I gotta thank John Coltrane and Miles Davis too.) ! I used to run up and down hill in the Caribbean before teaching biology at the University. </p>
				
                <p><strong>What have you accomplished thus far concerning your health?</strong>
                <br><strong>Sylvain: </strong>Winning the 2013 FitTrip at Blomeyer! That was the boost I needed, I lost 11 lbs of fat and gain 3.5 lbs of lean mass in 12 weeks, the shape of life. Besides that, the FitTrip was also a good lesson on how to properly exercise and how to adjust my diet.
                <br><strong>JP: </strong> Lost 40 pounds, run once a week 10k, ran 5K in 23 min, participated in Fit-Trip, Peachtree road race twice, Warrior dash...</p>
				
                <p><strong>What are your future wellness endeavors?</strong>
                <br><strong>Sylvain: </strong>I still want to add a little bit more muscles and also to improve my stamina, I plan do join a league and play soccer on a regular basis.
                <br><strong>JP: </strong>Win the next fit-trip. I wanna be like James Alston when I grow up! But also, I wanna run a half-marathon then a marathon per year. </p>
				
                <p><strong>Hometown?</strong>
                <br><strong>Sylvain: </strong>Lille, France
                <br><strong>JP: </strong>Abymes in Guadeloupe, French Caribbean, South of Puerto-Rico, North of Barbados (Lesser Antilles) and Yvelines, France (Paris area) where I  had to spend the most boring holidays ever (Eiffel tower, Champs Elysee, Notre Dame Cathedrale, Museums, Wine and Cheese, very boring, aren’t they ?) </p>
				
                <p><strong>What types of hobbies and interests do you have outside of exercising?</strong>
                <br><strong>Sylvain: </strong>Cooking, and particularly desserts, I recently became an expert on French Macarons. Playing games, video games, board games or card games, any kind of games actually. I’m also interested in the trading and economical aspect of one of the card game I play (Magic: the Gathering, to name it).
                <br><strong>JP: </strong>Movie clubs, Psychological thriller (Dexter), History of Science, Freethinking and Humanism, African history and arts, Science café. </p>
				
                <p><strong>Fun fact about you:</strong>
                <br><strong>Sylvain: </strong>Got lost in a Belgian highway with some friends, running very short of gas, got off the nearest exit in a small town in the middle of nowhere. None of our credit cards worked at the only gas station in miles. Entered the bar of the village and asked a random dude if he could use his “Belgian” credit card to fill my car. That worked…
                <br><strong>JP: </strong>I weighed almost 220 pounds (100kg) in 2007 during my PhD training, especially when I was in London, UK. Blame it on Beers, Fish ‘N Chips and watching soccer in British Pubs after my lab work! </p>
				
                <p><strong>Sylvain's Favorites:</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Favorite food: I’m a dessert addict, anything sweet I’m in.</li>
					<li>Movie: Sci-Fi movies in general</li>
					<li>Sport: Soccer! (The real football)</li>

                <h2>Article of the Month: National Golf Month</h2>
				<p>Golfing is often thought of as a passive sport that does not require any real degree of fitness. In reality, golf incorporates cardiovascular exercise, strength training, and even balance and coordination. With all of these benefits, it's hard to say no to a game of golf.</p>
                <h3>Walking</h3>
                <p>One of the best parts of golf, from a fitness standpoint, is the high amount of cardiovascular activity that is involved in the sport. Think about it—most golf courses are spread over multiple acres of hilly ground. Therefore, walking across a golf course is a great way to improve your cardiovascular system. Cardiovascular exercise is thought of as biking, swimming or jogging. However, when you walk (and not ride in a golf cart) during your golf game, you are sure to get the same kinds of cardiovascular benefits.</p>
                <h3>Strength Training</h3>
                <p>Another reason why golfing consists of more exercise than you think is because of the high amounts of strength training that goes on during the game. Swinging a golf club, in and of itself, is not very difficult from a strength training point of view. However, as discussed above, golf courses typically have lots of hills and valleys. Walking up these hills is sure to work the quadriceps and hamstrings, which help to make up the muscles of the lower body. In addition, lifting your golf bag from the car to the course, and carrying it around the course with you all day, is a great way to get your upper body strength training in for the week.</p>
                <h3>Balance</h3>
                <p>One of the best types of exercise that you can get from golfing is an increase in your ability to balance your body. A high degree of balance is not only   difficult to achieve, but is very important for a number of reasons. First, individuals who exhibit a great sense of balance often have a very strong core.  Your core includes the abdominal muscles, as well as the muscles of the lower back and even the buttocks. These muscles work together to help prevent back pain, falls and a number of other dangerous occurrences. Whenever you get a chance to work on   improving your balance, you should take it.</p>
                <h3>Concentration</h3>
                <p>Golf is a great way to exercise your body. However, as recent research has found, this is not the only type of exercise that your body needs. Exercising your brain is also very important not only for long life, but also for the prevention of brain degradation, which can result in memory loss. Golfing forces you to remember numbers, images, and even specific tips and techniques. Therefore, it is a great all-around way to exercise both body and mind.</p>
